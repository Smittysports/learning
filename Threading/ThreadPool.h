/** \page Threading
 * \section Thread Pool
 *
 * Poco has a ThreadPool class. Look at that for an exisiting library version
 * 
 * It is inneficient to always create and delete threads. If many threads are needed, and they can be managed, then it is better to
 * utilize a thread pool.
 *
 * Each thread should be running its own infinite loop, constantly waiting for new tasks to utlize them.
 * 
 * \section Promise and Future
 * 
 * A promise is an object that can store a value of type T to be retrieved by a future object (possibly in another thread),
 * offering a synchronization point.
 *
 * On construction, promise objects are associated to a new shared state on which they can store either a value of type T
 * or an exception derived from std::exception.
 * 
 * A shared state is a data structure or variable that can be accessed and modified by multiple functions.
 * It is different from a local state, which is only accessible within a single function.
 * 
 * This shared state can be associated to a future object by calling member get_future. After the call, both objects share
 * the same shared state:
 * - The promise object is the asynchronous provider and is expected to set a value for the shared state at some point.
 * - The future object is an asynchronous return object that can retrieve the value of the shared state, waiting for it to be ready, if necessary.
 *
 * The lifetime of the shared state lasts at least until the last object with which it is associated releases it or is destroyed.
 * Therefore it can survive the promise object that obtained it in the first place if associated also to a future.
 * 
 * \section Coroutines (C++20)
 * 
 * A coroutine is a function that can suspend execution to be resumed later. 
 * 
 * \section Other
 * 
 * Look up the C++Concurrency support library for more options

/** The BrianThreadPool class
 * 
 * 1) createInitialWorkerThreads will create all the initial threads and load them into the
 *    m_threads vector.
 * 2) The initialial threads, utilizing the ThreadLoop function, will all pend waiting on m_jobsToRun.pop()
 *    - If there are 10 threads in the m_threads vector, they will initially all be pending since the
 *      m_jobsToRun is empty
 * 3) Call addJob to add a new Thread to the m_jobsToRun queue. It should run as long as all of the threads in
 *    the m_threads are not busy running a Thread.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - A promise is used to store a value that can be set from a thread and read from another thread without
 *   causing a race condition
